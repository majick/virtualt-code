<P>VirtualT is an emulator for the Tandy line of laptop computers, specifically
the Model 100, Model 102 and Model 200.  The emulator has also been expanded to
support the Tandy's close relatives, the NEC PC-8201 and Ollivetti M10 models.

<H2>What is a Model T? </H2>
<P>  In 1983, Tandy Corporation introduced a laptop computer (The Model 100) based on a CMOS 
8085 processor running at 2.4 Mhz.  Since this was the world's first laptop, the Model 100 user
group likes to call it the "Model T".  The laptop has an integrated monochrome LCD display that is 40
characters by 8 lines, integrated 300 bps modem, serial and parallel ports, cassette interface port,
and 32K RAM.  The operating software is ROM based and includes BASIC, a text editor, and telecom,
schedule and address applications.  Also included is Menu program that allows the user to browse 
files stored in the laptop's RAM.

<H2>File Storage</H2>
<P>Files in the Model T are saved in the battery backed RAM using a very simple file system with a
fixed size File Directory Table.  On all emulated models except the T200, the directory table is
24 files in size.  For the T200, the table is 48 files.  The File Directory Table defines the name
of each file using an 8 character filename using a "6.2" format.  The File Directory Table also
defines the file attributes and starting memory loacation.
<P>
Files in memory are organized as contiguous memory objects and files of similar type are grouped
together in memory.  If a file size changes, then memory representing other files will be moved
to maintain contiguous memory usage.

<H2>MENU Program</H2>
<P>When the Model T is first powered on, it presents a display for interfacing with the Laptop's
ROM based applications and for selecting and using files stored in the the RAM filesystem.
