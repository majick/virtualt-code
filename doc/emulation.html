<h2><a name="keyboard">Display</a></h2>
<p>VirtualT emulates the Model T LCD display at the hardware level, like it does all other devices.
Because of this, all software written for the Model T will also work on VirtualT, even if they make
direct access to the LCD hardware.
<p>The LCD hardware implementation varies depending on the emulation model.  For the T200, the LCD
uses a single single controller with 8K display RAM.  On the other models, the LCD consists of 10
independant controllers, each responsibile for a specific region of the display.  With the exception
of the T200 control chip's character generator ROM, the VirtualT emulation exactly matches the
hardware at a register (I/O operation) level.
<p>Several features provided by the LCD emulation and can be accessed using the "Emulation->Display"
menu items.  These features are:
<UL>
<LI>Display Size:  Allows magnification of the LCD (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x).  This is direct pixel copying
of each pixel on the LCD.
<LI>Solid Chars:  Allows characters to be display with or without "spacing" between pixels.  On the real
Model T, the old LCD techonology was coarse enough to see the spacing.  This allows the user to 
choose between a "retro" look or a more readable look.
<LI>Framed:  This feature allows the user to view the LCD with the familiar "black frame" as seen on the
original Model T, complete with function key labels, or as a simple window.
</UL>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>The Model T keyboard, while very easy to use, has a non-standard of special and punctuation compared
with modern day keyboards.  The keyboard is a simple scan matrix of keys with 8 scan rows and 9 scan
columns.  Each model uses the same keyscan arragement, but each assigns the key mappings differently. 
Plus the Model T has a few extra keys that are not present on today's keyboards, such as CODE and GRPH.

<p>Because of these differences, VirtualT must perform keyboard translation based on the emulated Model.
Additionally, several keys of the standard 101-key keyboard are "mapped" to represent the extra keys
present on the Model T.  The mapping of these keys is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   F9        - Label Key
   F10       - Print Key
   F11       - Paste Key
   F12       - Pause Key
   Left Alt  - GRAPH
   Right Alt - CODE
</pre>

<p>There are no user controls for controlling the operation of the keyboard emulation.

<h2><a name="speed">Speed</a></h2>
<p>Emulation speed can be controlled using the "Emulation->Speed" menu item.  Emulation speed is calculated
by analyzing the number of CPU cycles that have occurred over a given time interval.  A high-resolution timer
is used to measure time in milliseconds for accurate measurement.  Even using a high-resolution timer, the 
speed estimates calculated are still approximate.  For emulation speeds less than full speed, VirtualT slows
the emulation by performing an FLTK wait operation, effectively giving control back to the OS and putting the
application to "sleep".  There are four options for emulation speed accessible in the "Emulation->Speed" menu:
<p>
<pre>
   2.4 Mhz           - Forces emulation to match origial Model T speed
   Very CPU Friendly - Moderate emulation speed - consumes fewer Host CPU cycles 
   CPU Friendly      - Faster emulation speed - cosumes more Host CPU cycles
   Max Speed         - Provides the fastest emulation
</pre>

<h2><a name="optrom">Option ROMs</a></h2>
<p>The Model T laptops use a system ROM to store the operating system and built-in applications.  In addition
to the built in Operating System ROM (OpSys ROM), the laptops have a socket for adding an additional "Option ROM"
in a covered compartment on the bottom of the unit.  Various option ROMs were developed for the Model T and are
still available today at varous on-line stores / auctions.
<p>VirtualT provides emulation of the Option ROM functinality via menu items on the "Emulation->Option ROM" menu.
The sub-menu title will display the currently loaded Option ROM, if any, and the "Load ROM" and "Unload ROM" items
can be used to control which "ROM" is loaded.  A single ROM can be "loaded" at any given time by choosing the
"Load ROM" menu item and selecting the ROM image file from the browser dialog box.  The ROM image files can be either
binary or Intel-Hex formatted files.  The selected ROM image file will be saved with other Preferences and will
be associated with the current emulation model.   

<h2><a name="memory">Memory Setup</a></h2>
<p>Each Model T was shipped with base memory and an option to install additional memory base on the model.
The Model 100 was upgradeable in 8K increments up to 32K while the Model 200 was upgradeable in 24K increments
up to 72K.  Additional memory expansion products were developed as add-on modules to increase available memory.
Most of these products were designed to connect to the system bus in the expansion compartment on the bottom of
the laptop and provided 128K or 256K of expansion.  The newest expansion module called "ReMem" was developed
by Steven Adolph in the 2006 / 2007 timeframe.  This device boosts the memory capability of the Model T to 
2Meg RAM plus 4Meg FLASH, plus provides legacy interface protocol for the Rampac expansion module.

<p>The default memory emulation in VirutalT matches that of a factory standard unit with maximum RAM expansion.
he selected model.  Additional memory emulation configurations can be selected using the 
"Emulation->Memory Configuration" menu.  This menu item will display the Memory Configuration dialog box 
shown below.
<p><img src="memory_setup.jpg" align="center">

<p>The details of each option are:
<ul>
<li><b>Base Memory </b>- Emulates the maximum "Factory Shipped" memory configuration.
<li><b>Rampac </b> - Emulates Base Memory plus a 256K RAM Rampac expansion module.
<li><b>ReMem </b> - Emulates a ReMem expansion module.  Rampac accesses can be "emulated" by the ReMem
and will show up in the ReMem memory space and RAM file.
<li><b>ReMem + RamPac </b> - Emulates a ReMem expansion module and a Rampac.  Rampac accesses are directed
to the Rampac memory space and saved in the Rampac RAM file.
<p><li>Make option ROM R/W - Useful for ReMem emulation.  Allows writes to the OptionROM space.
<li>Patch ROM onload (...) - Enables / disables automatic patching to display version on MENU screen.
</ul>

<h2><a name="peripheral">Peripheral Setup</a></h2>
<p>The Peripheral Setup dialog box is accessed via the "Emulation->Peripheral Setup" menu item and allows
configuration of peripheral emulation options.  Currenlty the only peripheral that is supported is the
serial port.  The Peripheral Setup dialog is displayed below.  It has a separate configuration tab for each
of of the peripherals on the Model T, although most of them are simply placeholders for future functionality.

<p><img src="periph_setup.jpg" align="center">

<h3>COM port setup tab</h3>
<p>This tab provides configuration options for emulation of the Model T serial port.  The controls on this tab
provide the follwoing functionality:
<ul>
<li><b>No emulation</b> - No serial port emulation provided.
<li><b>Use Simulated Port</b> - Not supported.  The idea is to provide a scriptable way to emulate something 
connected to a serial port with action / response capabilities.
<li><b>Use Host Port</b> - Provides a list of know host ports to "connect" to the Model T's serial port.
<li><b>Use Other Host Port</b> - Allows the user to type a device name to "connect" to the Model T's serial port.
</ul>
<p>All serial port traffic and configuration updates are trapped by VirtualT and translated into the
appropriate OS system calls to affect the desired response on a "real-world" serial device.  Serial I/O and
configuration data can be monitored in the <a href="tools.html#periph">Peripherial Devices</a> dialog.
